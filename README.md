# My dotfiles

## Neovim

I don't have the prettiest or most fully-featured Neovim config. I almost exclusively use Neovim embedded within VS Code, through the [VSCode Neovim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim) plugin.

I found that most dotfile managers were too complicated for what should ultimately be simple and easy to migrate across different platforms. Git, symlinks, and a few short scripts are all you need.
